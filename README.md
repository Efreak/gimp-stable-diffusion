# gimp-stable-diffusion
This repository includes two different GIMP plugins, which can be used for generating images with stable-diffusion:

### Stablehorde
This plugin can be used without running a stable-diffusion server yourself. It uses [Stablehorde](https://stablehorde.net) as the backend. Stablehorde is a cluster of stable-horde servers run by volunteers. [Check it out](https://github.com/blueturtleai/gimp-stable-diffusion/tree/main/stablehorde).

### Local
This plugin uses a stable-diffusion server you run on your own computer. A GPU is needed. [Check it out](https://github.com/blueturtleai/gimp-stable-diffusion/tree/main/local).
